# Echo of You MVP Requirements Document

## Introduction

Echo of You (EOY) is a visual novel game built with Ren'Py that tells the story of students at Saint Rose Academy using a memory-sharing device called "P.mem". The MVP focuses on Volume 1 (上編) prototype featuring core visual novel functionality with character selection, information gathering through dialogue, and simple romance routes.

The game follows Yu, a student who leads the LOG club with three female members: Kyoko, Luna, and Honoka. Players experience the story through branching dialogue, character interactions, and strategic information collection to progress through romantic storylines. The MVP will demonstrate the core concept of memory sharing and relationship building while establishing the foundation for future volumes.
